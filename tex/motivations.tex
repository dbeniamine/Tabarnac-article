\section{Motivations}
\label{sec:motivations}

In this section we provides some motivation for analysis tools such as
\TABARNAC~ and we illustrate them using naive implementations of matrix
multiplication. We do not aim at providing efficient matrix multiplication,
but at showing classical bad NUMA behaviour and how they can be visualized and
improved with tools such as \TABARNAC.
