\section{Experimental methodology}
\label{sec:metho}

This section briefly discusses our evaluation methodology of \TABARNAC.
We present the hardware architecture, the applications that will be used in
the analysis and the mapping policies to which we compare our propositions.

\subsection{Hardware Environment}
\label{sec:expe-setup}

We used two NUMA machines for our experiments \texttt{Turing} and
\texttt{Idfreeze}. The second machine was only used to compare the
instrumentation overhead on Intel and AMD machines, all the other experiments
ran on \texttt{turing}. The hardware details are
summarized in Table~\ref{tab:hw}. \texttt{Turing} runs version $3.13$ of the
Linux kernel, while \texttt{Idfreeze} uses verions $3.2$.

%\texttt{Turing} is composed of $4$ Intel Xeon X7550
%processors (Nehalem microarchitecture~\cite{Intel2010}). Each processor has its own memory controller and therefore forms a NUMA node. The hardware details are summarized in Table~\ref{tab:turing}.
%The machine runs version 3.13 of the Linux kernel.
%
%\texttt{Idfreeze} is composed of $4$ AMD Opteron $6174$ 

%Boths machines are composed of $4$ processors.  Each processor has its own memory
%controller and therefore forms a NUMA node.

\subsection{Applications}

We evaluate the following applications with \TABARNAC in this paper: %a \emph{matrix multiplication},
the \emph{IS} benchmark and \emph{Ondes3D}.
They were chosen to demonstrate different memory access behaviors with different strategies to improve them.

%The \emph{matrix multiplication} is a well-known algorithm that we use to verify the accuracy of \TABARNAC, as well as to discuss the performance improvements that can be achieved.
\emph{IS} is a benchmark from the OpenMP implementation of the NAS Parallel Benchmark suite~(NPB)~\cite{Jin1999}. \emph{IS} sorts a set of integer numbers using a parallel bucket sort algorithm.
\emph{Ondes3D} is the main numerical kernel of the Ondes3D
application~\cite{Dupros2008}. It simulates the propagation of seismic waves
using a finite-differences numerical method. All our benchmarks use OpenMP for
parallelization.
%The \emph{matrix multiplication} is implemented with Pthreads, while \emph{IS} and \emph{Ondes3D} use OpenMP for parallelization.

All applications were compiled with \texttt{gcc}, version 4.6.3, with the \texttt{-O2} optimization flag.
Both analysis and performance evaluation is performed with $64$ threads,
which is the maximum number of threads that our evaluation machine can execute
in parallel. %The \emph{matrix multiplication} performance was evaluated with
%matrices of size $4096 \times 4096$ doubles and $8192 \times 8192$, resulting on
%a memory usage of $128$Mib and $512Mib$ per matrix.
\emph{IS} was executed
with input class \emph{D}, resulting in a memory usage of $33.5$Gib, Finally, Ondes3D has a memory usage of $11.3$Gib.

\subsection{Mapping Policies}

In the performance evaluation, we compare the following three traditional
mapping policies to the version modified using knowledge provided by \TABARNAC.
The \emph{original Linux kernel} forms our baseline for the experiments. We use an unmodified Linux kernel, version 3.13, with the first-touch policy. The NUMA Balancing mechanism is disabled in this baseline.
The \emph{interleave} policy is performed with the help of the \texttt{numactl} tool.
We also compare our results to the recently introduced \emph{NUMA Balancing} technique~\cite{Corbet}, which is executed with its default configuration.

For the plots presenting speedups, each configuration was executed at least 10 times. Each point represents the arithmetic mean of all runs.
The error bars in those plots represent the standard error.


\section{Analysis and Results}
\label{sec:expe-analysis}

This section presents the results of our analysis.
For each application, we show its memory access behavior, discuss strategies to optimize this behavior and present the performance improvements that can be achieved.

% In this section, we analyze several benchmarks using \TABARNAC, we discuss
% their memory access distribution. Using this analysis we propose some
% optimizations and we evaluate them by comparing it to automatic data mapping
% tools.

% \subsection{Matrix Multiplication}
% \label{sec:exp-mat}

% The first benchmark presented is based on a naive matrix multiplication,
% computing $C=A \times B$. Our aim here is not to provide a kernel competing with the
% state of the art, but to show how \TABARNAC can help to improve such
% applications. We compare two implementations of the matrix multiplication, in
% the first one, called \emph{Naive}, each thread starts by computing
% $C[0][tid]$ and then jumps $N$ elements after in the matrix, where $N$ is the
% number of threads. Although this implementation is known to be inefficient, it is a
% good example of NUMA-unaware code, and comparing the \TABARNAC visualization
% for this algorithm to the one obtained with a better version helps understanding
% how to interpret it.
% Moreover, when an application has such an unstructured memory access pattern, it
% is not always possible to change the pattern completely. Therefore, it is
% interesting to discuss the improvements that can be obtained in this kernel without
% modifying the algorithm.
% The optimized implementation of the matrix multiplication uses a non-recursive block
% decomposition.

%     }
%     \caption{Per-thread access distribution on data structures B and C for the
%     matrix multiplication.}
%     \label{fig:matrix-analysis}
% \end{figure}
% % The figures presented in this sections are part of the \TABARNAC visualization.
% The analysis of the matrix multiplication is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:matrix-analysis}.
% Each plot shows the number of memory accesses for a particular data structure
% per page and per thread. Only structures \texttt{B} and \texttt{C} are
% presented, since \texttt{A} has a very similar access
% pattern as \texttt{C} for both implementations.
% For the naive matrix multiplication, all pages of both structures are used by every
% thread, as we can see in
% Figures~\ref{fig:matrix-B-naive}~and~\ref{fig:matrix-C-naive}. Therefore, when we execute this code on a NUMA machine, wherever we
% map the page, all the nodes but one will trigger remote memory accesses. There
% are several ways to improve this behavior: an easy solution
% is to tell the operating system to interleave pages through the different
% nodes. This will result in a better balance of memory bandwidth between the
% nodes. Another solution is to create local copies of \texttt{A} and
% \texttt{B} on each node as these matrices are only read. Finally, we can modify
% the algorithm to improve the locality, which means using the block algorithm.

% %\begin{figure}[htb]
% %    \centering
% %    \subfigure[Structure B (block version).]{
% %        \includegraphics[height=.24\textheight] {mat_B_bloc}
% %        \label{fig:matrix-B-bloc}
% %    }
% %    \subfigure[Structure C (block version).]{
% %        \includegraphics[height=.24\textheight] {mat_C_bloc}
% %        \label{fig:matrix-C-bloc}
% %    }
% %    \caption{By thread access distribution on data structures A and B for the
% %    block matrix multiplication.}
% %    \label{fig:matrix-bloc}
% %\end{figure}

% As we can see in Figures~\ref{fig:matrix-B-bloc}~and~\ref{fig:matrix-C-bloc}, the block algorithm improves the page
% locality compared to the naive implementation. In our algorithm, structures \texttt{B}
% and \texttt{C} are not divided the same way, resulting in two different access patterns. For structure \texttt{B} (Figure~\ref{fig:matrix-B-bloc}), the pages still
% have similar numbers of accesses for all threads. Structures \texttt{C} and
% \texttt{A} (Figure~\ref{fig:matrix-C-bloc}) are split in two parts. The first half
% is shared by threads $T0$ and $T2$ while the two others work on the second
% half. This behavior provides strong page locality and is therefore more
% suitable for NUMA machines. We can easily put each part of \texttt{C} (and
% \texttt{A}) on a NUMA node and map the threads using them to this node, while matrix
% \texttt{B} can be distributed using an interleave policy.

% To evaluate the performance improvements of the proposed modifications, we compare the execution
% time of both versions of the code (naive and block) with the mapping suggested by \TABARNAC to the original Linux kernel (base), and to NUMA Balancing.
% For the naive version, the interleave policy is identical to \TABARNAC and is therefore not shown separately.
% We use bigger matrix for the block version than for the naive one as this
% algorithm is designed to benefit from cache and thus reduce the impact of NUMA
% mapping policy.


% \begin{figure}[htb]
%     \centering
%     \includegraphics[width=.7\linewidth]{mat_time}
%     \caption{Speedup of the matrix multiplication for size $4096 \times 4096$
%     doubles (naive) and size $8192 \times 8192$ doubles (block).}
%     \label{fig:matrix-res}
% \end{figure}

% Figure~\ref{fig:matrix-res} shows the experimental results of the matrix multiplication. We can see that for
% the naive algorithm, NUMA Balancing is already quite efficient and results in a $40\%$
% speedup. However, using the \TABARNAC policy avoids the runtime overhead and
% allows us to obtain almost $50\%$ of speedup. For the block version, even with
% matrix $4$ times bigger, all policies provide similar execution times, as this
% algorithm is designed to fit in the caches of the system, such that the NUMA
% policy should not influence the results.

% This example shows
% how \TABARNAC can help improving an application by highlighting an inefficient
% memory access behavior. This knowledge can be used two different ways, and always
% results in significant performance improvements. Either the user can modify the code to
% improve the access distribution (in this case going from the naive to the block version),
% or at least \TABARNAC will help choosing the best NUMA page mapping policy.

\subsection{IS}

        \emph{IS} with $64$ threads. Original behavior on the left, after
    modification on the right.}
    \label{fig:is-behaviour}

\end{figure}

The \emph{IS} benchmark in its default version has an unstructured memory access behavior\footnote{\url{http://www.nas.nasa.gov/publications/npb.html}}. Thus, it is a good candidate to be optimized using \TABARNAC.

The left side of Figure~\ref{fig:is-behaviour} shows the original access distributions for the
three main structures of \emph{IS} class \emph{B} with $64$ threads. We can see that
each structure has a different access pattern: \texttt{key\_array}'s
(Figure~\ref{fig:is-behaviour-orig-kba}) access distribution shows that every
thread works on a different part of the structure, which allows automated
tools to perform an efficient data/thread mapping on it. On the other hand, \texttt{key\_buff2}
(Figure~\ref{fig:is-behaviour-orig-kb2}) is completely shared by all threads.
\texttt{key\_buff1}'s access distribution (Figure~\ref{fig:is-behaviour-orig-kb1})
is the most interesting one. The pages $500$ to $1500$ are
accessed by each thread more than every other page. More precisely, every
thread seems to have a Gaussian distribution of accesses centered on the
middle of \texttt{key\_buff1}. With such a distribution, automated tools might
generate a lot of page migrations.

\lstinputlisting[caption=\emph{IS} code responsible for the
Gaussian distribution of memory accesses to the \texttt{key\_buff1} structure., label=lst:is, float=htb]{code/is.c}


With this knowledge, we can identify the source of the
Gaussian pattern in the \emph{IS} source code. Indeed, all the accesses to \texttt{key\_buff1} are linear,
except the ones shown in Listing~\ref{lst:is}\footnote{
    The code has been slightly modified to make it more readable. In the
    original version, the arrays \texttt{key\_buff1} (resp. \texttt{key\_buff2})
    are accessed via a generic pointer called \texttt{key\_buff\_ptr} (resp.
    \texttt{key\_buff\_ptr2}).
}, line \ref{lst:is-gaus-end}, which depend on the values of
\texttt{key\_buff2}.
By default, OpenMP threads are scheduled dynamically to avoid unbalanced
distribution of work, but the developers also propose a cyclic distribution
of the threads over the loop. As we know that the values of \texttt{key\_buff2}
follow a Gaussian distribution, we can design a distribution of the threads that
provides both a good load balancing and locality of data. For the distribution, we split
the loop into two equal parts and distribute each part among the threads in a round-robin way. This can be done by modifying the OpenMP pragma (line~\ref{lst:is-sched} in the original code), as shown
in Listing~\ref{lst:is-modif}.

\begin{lstlisting}[float=!h,caption=Optimization for \emph{IS}., label=lst:is-modif]
#pragma omp for schedule(static,NUM_BUCKETS/(2*omp_get_num_threads()))
\end{lstlisting}



With this simple code modification, we obtain the access distribution
shown in the right side of Figure~\ref{fig:is-behaviour}. We can see that the Gaussian
access pattern of \texttt{key\_buff1} is now better balanced between the threads. Each page
of this structure is mostly used by only one thread. Moreover,
\texttt{key\_buff2}'s access distribution has also changed. We can see that
each thread uses mostly one part of the array.
The main point of our code modification is to improve the affinity between
thread and memory, therefore we need to pin each thread on a core to keep them
close to the data they access. To perform the mapping, we use the \texttt{GOMP\_CPU\_AFFINITY} environment variable. \TABARNAC
also shows us that the first touch is always done by the thread actually using
the data for IS, therefore we do not need to explicitly map the data to the NUMA nodes.

We compare the execution time of \emph{IS} (class \emph{D}) for the three scheduling
methods, \emph{Dynamic}, \emph{Cyclic} with a step of $1$ and \TABARNAC:
cyclic with the proposed distribution. For the two first methods, we compare the
execution time on the base operating system, the interleave policy and with NUMA balancing enabled. Interleave and NUMA Balancing are not relevant with the
\TABARNAC modifications and are therefore not included.

\begin{figure}[htb]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=.63\linewidth]{is_exectime}
    \caption{Speedup for \emph{IS} (class D) compared to the baseline.}
\label{fig:is-res}
\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{fig:is-res} shows the speedup of \emph{IS} compared to
the default version (\emph{Dynamic}) for each scheduling method and for each
optimization technique. The first thing to notice is that with the default
\emph{Dynamic} scheduling, both Interleave and NUMA Balancing slow
the application down, by up to $10\%$. This shows that simple, automatic optimization policies are can actually reduce performance
for NUMA-unaware code.
The \emph{Cyclic} policy, proposed in the original code, already provides up to $13\%$ of
speedup. We can see that both interleave and NUMA Balancing are not suitable
for this policy, since they reduce the performance gains.
The \TABARNAC version provides more than $20\%$ of speedup with a very small code
modification.
This example shows how analyzing an application's memory behavior can lead to
significant execution time improvement where automatic techniques can actually slow
the application down.

\subsection{Ondes3D}
\label{sec:exp-ondes3d}

\begin{figure}[htb]
    \centering

    \subfigure[Original access distribution.]{
        \includegraphics[width=.45\linewidth] {ondes3d_vz0_dist_orig}

    \subfigure[Access distribution after modifications.]{
        \includegraphics[width=.45\linewidth] {ondes3d_vz0_dist_modif}

    }
    \subfigure[Original First-touch.]{
        \includegraphics[width=.45\linewidth] {ondes3d_vz0_ft_orig}

    }
    \caption{Access and first-touch distribution  for structure
        \texttt{vz0} from \emph{Ondes3D}. Original version on the left side,
    after modifications on the right.}
    \label{fig:ondes3d}
\end{figure}

The analysis of the access distributions of \emph{Ondes3D} shows that each
structure seems to be well divided between the threads, as we can see for
structure \texttt{vz0} in Figure~\ref{fig:ondes3d-behaviour-vz0-orig}, still
if we look closely, we can see a light horizontal line indicating that
thread~$0$ is accessing at least once the whole structure.Indedd,the first
touch distribution (Figure~\ref{fig:ondes3d-ft-vz0-orig}), shows that
thread~$0$ is responsible for all first accesses to this structure. Due to
this pattern, if we run \emph{Ondes3D} without any mapping, every page will be
mapped to the NUMA node that executes thread~$0$, resulting in many remote
accesses for the other threads. An easy fix is to perform the initialization
in parallel and to pin each thread on a different core.



Such modifications result in the access distribution shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:ondes3d-behaviour-vz0-modif}. We can see that now the thread~$0$ accesses only
its own portion of the structure. Moreover, Figure~\ref{fig:ondes3d-ft-vz0-modif} shows that the first touch is now distributed
over the structures and matches the actual access distribution, as expected.

\begin{figure}[htb]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=.63\linewidth]{ondes3d_exectime}
    \caption{Speedup for \emph{Ondes3D} compared to the original application.}
\label{fig:ondes-res}
\end{figure}

We evaluate the modified version by comparing it with the original
version, running on the normal OS, with NUMA Balancing activated and with an
interleave policy. Figure~\ref{fig:ondes-res} present the results of this
evaluation. We can see that all methods improve the execution time, but
NUMA Balancing provides less than $30\%$ speedup, while the static mappings
(Interleave or the modified code) allows us to get almost $60\%$ of speedup. This is
due to the training time described in section \ref{sec:soa-mapping}. Indeed,
with NUMA Balancing, all pages are initially mapped by the OS to the NUMA node
of thread~$0$, they
are only moved later on, after many remote accesses have already occurred. This is a case where static mapping can be substantially better than automated
tools. The Interleave policy provides a similar speedup as
\TABARNAC since it distributes the pages over the NUMA nodes at the beginning of
the execution.
% Nevertheless, the interleave version only maps the data no the
% threads, therefore the performances might drop if the OS does not map them
% ``correctly'' while the modified version proposes a thread mapping that ensures better
% data locality.

\subsection{Overhead Analysis}
\label{sec:expe-overhead}

Our last experiment aims at evaluating the instrumentation cost. To do so, we
executed all of the NAS Parallel Benchmarks in class \emph{B} with $64$
threads on both machines and compared the original execution time to the execution time with instrumentation enabled.

    \caption{Overhead of \TABARNAC instrumentation for the NAS Parallel
    Benchmarks, class B on both Intel and AMD machine.}
    \label{tab:ovh}
\end{table}

We can see in Table~\ref{tab:ovh} that, on the Intel machine,
the instrumentation application is $10$ to $30$ times slower than the normal
execution. On the AMD machine, the overhead is almost always higher, for
pathological cases, the instrumentation is two to three times slower.
%On most benchmarks, the instrumentation is $10$ to $50\%$ slower on
%AMD than on Intel processor. For the pathological cases (\texttt{FT} and
%\texttt{BT}) the instrumentation can be two or three time slower on AMD. 
Although this overhead is not negligible, we have to consider the fact that often we can instrument
smaller versions of the applications, as we focus on the general behavior.
Moreover, as we do not use sampling, our instrumentation is deterministic and
there is no need to run it several times. Finally, as our
analysis is designed to be used during the development phase and not by an
automated tool during the execution, a factor of $30$ is reasonable.

\subsection{Summary}

Our experiments have highlighted the fact that although automated tools such
as NUMA Balancing can be efficient, in several cases they result in
performance losses. Moreover, although simple static mapping policies
can result in substantial improvements, the best policy depends on the memory access behavior of the parallel application. Therefore, it is necessary to understand its memory behavior to
select the most appropriate mapping policy.

Our tools and methodology enables developers and users to achieve performance improvements in two ways. First, by
providing a deep understanding of the memory access behavior, it allows the user to
find the best mapping policy. Second, this knowledge can be used to
identify and fix inefficient memory behavior. Our experiments showed that both
situations result in significant performance gains.
